    {
        question: "What is a tropical cyclone?",
        choices: ["A calm, clear weather pattern", "A type of rock formation", "A rapidly rotating storm system", "A slow-moving cloud formation"],
        correct: "A rapidly rotating storm system",
        explanation: "A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain."

    {
        question: "How does frost action cause weathering?",
        choices: ["By cooling the air", "By water freezing and expanding in cracks of rocks", "By forming icicles on cliffs", "By increasing humidity"],
        correct: "By water freezing and expanding in cracks of rocks",
        explanation: "Frost action causes weathering when water seeps into cracks in rocks, freezes, and expands, which eventually breaks the rock apart."

    {
        question: "What is the primary energy source for a tropical cyclone?",
        choices: ["Solar energy", "Geothermal energy", "Energy from oceanic water vapor", "Energy from cold air masses"],
        correct: "Energy from oceanic water vapor",

    },
    {
        question: "What does the term 'abrasion' refer to in the context of erosion?",
        choices: ["The smoothing of surfaces by chemical reactions", "The grinding away of rock by other rock particles carried in water, ice, or wind", "The deposit of sediment in new locations", "The formation of soil layers"],
        correct: "The grinding away of rock by other rock particles carried in water, ice, or wind",
        explanation: "Abrasion in erosion is the physical scraping of a rock surface by friction between rocks and moving particles during their transport by wind, glacier, waves, gravity, running water."
    },
    {
        question: "Which climate condition discourages the formation of tropical cyclones?",
        choices: ["Warm ocean waters", "Cold ocean waters", "High atmospheric instability", "Low air pressure"],
        correct: "Cold ocean waters",
        explanation: "Tropical cyclones typically form over warm ocean waters and are less likely to form when ocean waters are cold."
    },
    {
        question: "What role do trees and plants play in preventing erosion?",
        choices: ["They break the wind speed", "Their roots stabilize the soil", "They attract animals that dig burrows", "They increase water absorption"],
        correct: "Their roots stabilize the soil",
        explanation: "The roots of trees and plants help to stabilize the soil, reducing erosion by anchoring the soil in place and absorbing water."
    },
    {
        question: "What is an example of chemical weathering?",
        choices: ["A tree root splitting a rock", "The polishing effect of sand blown against a rock", "Iron rusting in rock formations", "Rocks cracking from freeze-thaw cycles"],
        correct: "Iron rusting in rock formations",
        explanation: "Chemical weathering includes the rusting of iron in rock, which involves a chemical change where iron reacts with oxygen and water."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a common result of erosion along coastlines?",
        choices: ["Beach formation", "The creation of mountains", "The growth of forests", "Desert formation"],
        correct: "Beach formation",
        explanation: "Erosion along coastlines often results in the formation of beaches as materials such as sand are moved from one place to another along the shore."
    },
    {
        question: "Why do tropical cyclones weaken over land?",
        choices: ["Lack of moisture", "Colder temperatures", "Higher air pressure", "All of the above"],
        correct: "Lack of moisture",
        explanation: "Tropical cyclones weaken over land primarily because they are cut off from their primary energy source, the warm ocean water vapor."
    },
    {
        question: "Which process involves the transfer of rock and soil downhill due to gravity?",
        choices: ["Tectonic movement", "Mass wasting", "Condensation", "Transpiration"],
        correct: "Mass wasting",
        explanation: "Mass wasting is the process that involves the movement of soil and rock downhill due to gravity, commonly seen in landslides and rockfalls."
    },
    {
        question: "What type of rock is most susceptible to chemical weathering?",
        choices: ["Granite", "Sandstone", "Limestone", "Quartzite"],
        correct: "Limestone",
        explanation: "Limestone is particularly susceptible to chemical weathering, especially from acid rain, because it is composed largely of calcite which reacts with acidic solutions."
    },
    {
        question: "How do human activities increase soil erosion?",
        choices: ["By planting trees", "By building dams", "By overgrazing and deforestation", "By fishing"],
        correct: "By overgrazing and deforestation",
        explanation: "Human activities such as overgrazing and deforestation remove vegetation cover, increasing soil erosion as there are fewer roots to hold the soil in place."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the scale used to measure the intensity of tropical cyclones?",
        choices: ["Fujita Scale", "Richter Scale", "Saffir-Simpson Scale", "Mercalli Scale"],
        correct: "Saffir-Simpson Scale",
        explanation: "The Saffir-Simpson Scale is used to measure the intensity of tropical cyclones, categorizing them based on their wind speed."
    },
    {
        question: "Which area would most likely experience high rates of erosion?",
        choices: ["A flat, vegetated plain", "A steep, bare mountain slope", "A frozen tundra", "A densely forested area"],
        correct: "A steep, bare mountain slope",
        explanation: "Steep, bare mountain slopes are more likely to experience high rates of erosion due to lack of vegetation to protect the soil and gravity pulling materials downhill."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens during the process of exfoliation in weathering?",
        choices: ["Soil layers are compressed", "Rocks are polished by wind", "Outer layers of rock peel off", "Water transports soil particles"],
        correct: "Outer layers of rock peel off",
        explanation: "Exfoliation is a weathering process where outer rock layers peel off due to pressure release or thermal expansion and contraction."
    },
    {
        question: "What impact does a tropical cyclone have on ocean temperatures?",
        choices: ["It cools the ocean by mixing surface and deeper waters", "It heats the ocean significantly", "It has no impact on ocean temperatures", "It causes the ocean to freeze"],
        correct: "It cools the ocean by mixing surface and deeper waters",
        explanation: "Tropical cyclones can lead to temporary cooling of surface waters, as the intense winds and waves mix warmer surface water with deeper, cooler water."
    },
    {
        question: "What feature is typically formed by water erosion?",
        choices: ["Deserts", "Mountains", "River valleys", "Plateaus"],
        correct: "River valleys",
        explanation: "River valleys are typically formed by water erosion as rivers cut through the land over time, carrying away soil and rock."
    },
    {
        question: "Which factor increases the rate of chemical weathering?",
        choices: ["Cold, dry climates", "Hot, humid climates", "High altitudes", "Low pressure systems"],
        correct: "Hot, humid climates",
        explanation: "Chemical weathering rates increase in hot, humid climates because higher temperatures and moisture levels accelerate chemical reactions."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the primary cause of desertification?",
        choices: ["Heavy rainfall", "Forest growth", "Soil erosion", "Glacial movement"],
        correct: "Soil erosion",
        explanation: "Desertification is primarily caused by soil erosion, which removes the topsoil necessary for plants to grow, reducing the land's fertility."
    },
    {
        question: "What natural barrier can help protect coastlines from erosion?",
        choices: ["Coral reefs", "Sand dunes", "Mountain ranges", "Both coral reefs and sand dunes"],
        correct: "Both coral reefs and sand dunes",
        explanation: "Coral reefs and sand dunes both serve as natural barriers that protect coastlines from the erosive forces of waves and storms."
